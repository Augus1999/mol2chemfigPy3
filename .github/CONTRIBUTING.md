# Contributing to mol2chemfigPy3

### Before reporting an issue
If you are sure your SMILES string is correct in syntax but still constantly got failed in converting to chemfig code, please try adding `-r` to bypass the structure checks.

### Feature request?
I hardly accept feature request for this project. The point of this project is to keep `mol2chemfig` alive for as long as possible, however, if you already have a solution of a new feature, feel free to discuss and pull requests.
